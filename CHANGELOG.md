[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`constrained_realization` with zero-power multipoles** (e.g. `Cl[0:2] = 0`,
  the standard zeroed monopole/dipole) returned garbage for the *physical* modes:
  the old `1/Cl → 1e30` prior injected ~1e15-scale noise into the CG RHS, so the
  relative-residual stopping rule fired before the physical modes were solved
  (measured relative error ~1 vs the dense solve; ~3e-9 with all-positive Cl).
  `wiener` and `constrained_realization` now solve in **prior-whitened**
  coordinates (`P = diag(√Cl)`, operator `P·A_x·P + I`): zero-power modes are
  pinned to 0 exactly, no `1/Cl` scale ever enters the system, and the operator
  is much better conditioned (eigenvalues ≥ 1). Same math, same posterior;
  regression-gated with zero-Cl spectra in `tests/test_wiener.py`.
- **Off-grid pointing gradients at grid-aligned points** — `jax.grad` of
  `synthesis_general` w.r.t. `loc` returned `±inf` whenever θ or φ landed exactly
  on an oversampled-grid node (θ ∈ {0, π}, φ = 0, …): the ES-kernel support
  boundary has an infinite `sqrt` derivative. The kernel now excludes the
  boundary with a double-`where` guard (value change ≤ e^(−β), below every
  kernel tier); gradients are finite everywhere. Regression-gated in
  `tests/test_diff_offgrid.py`.

### Added
- **Input validation** — `synthesis` / `adjoint_synthesis` /
  `synthesis_general` / `adjoint_synthesis_general` now raise `ValueError` on
  wrong-shape `alm` / map / `field` / `loc` (previously silently clamped by the
  gather → silently wrong results), and `adjoint_synthesis_general` rejects
  complex fields. `wiener` / `constrained_realization` validate the `signal_cl`
  length.
- **Warnings** — the on-grid transforms warn once per geometry when
  `lmax > 1.5·nside` (the documented design ceiling, previously unenforced), and
  all transforms warn when `jax_enable_x64` is off (silent float32 execution).

### Changed
- **Accuracy docs** — corrected the ring-weight exactness claim: `Lw = 2·nside`
  covers the analysis quadrature products in full only for `lmax ≤ nside`, not
  the whole `1.5·nside` band. Added the measured band-ceiling table (weighted
  `niter=3`: ~1e-13 at `lmax = nside` → ~5e-7 at `lmax = 1.5·nside`; `niter=8`
  recovers ~1e-14) to `docs/accuracy.md`, a band-ceiling row (`nside=64,
  lmax=96`) to the accuracy gate, and a `DISCREPANCIES.md` entry.
- **Docs** — rewrote `docs/` for a public audience: removed consumer-specific
  (BICEP/Keck, bk-jax) and development-process references, trimmed `motivation.md`
  to a concise justification, and de-jargoned (e.g. MUSE → field-level inference).
  No code or API changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **`enable_compilation_cache(dir)`** — opt in to JAX's persistent on-disk
  compilation cache. The nside≥1024 on-grid compile is multi-minute and structural
  (~458 s at nside=2048, ~93% the per-ring-length FFT unroll); the cache makes it
  pay-once-ever rather than per run. Consumer-opted-in (like x64); numerics untouched.
  Measured table in `docs/performance.md`.
- **Off-grid real-DOF layer** — `synthesis_general_real` (`S_g ∘ T⁻¹`) and
  `adjoint_synthesis_general_real` (`T ∘ S_gᵀ`): the arbitrary-pointing duals of
  `synthesis_real`, a plain real-linear `ℝⁿ→ℝᵐ` over spin 0–3 (`jacfwd ≡ jacrev`,
  native VJP == the exact transpose, no `2·conj` bridge). The ergonomic
  gradient-based entry point to the NUFFT path.

### Changed
- **`map2alm` → `analysis`** — the map→aₗₘ inverse is now canonically `jht.analysis`,
  the field-standard mirror of `synthesis` (and consistent with `bare_analysis` /
  `analysis_real`). **`jht.map2alm` stays as a back-compat alias** (same object), so
  nothing breaks. The internal module `jht/analysis.py` moved to `jht/_analysis.py`.
- **CI** — a `slow` marker splits the heavy off-grid oracle suite out of the fast
  subset; `test.yml` runs that fast subset (`pixi run test-fast`, ~5 min) on pushes
  to `main` and on PRs, while the full suite (`full-suite.yml`, `pixi run test`)
  stays **manual-only** (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Pixi manifest table `[tool.pixi.project]` → `[tool.pixi.workspace]` (the deprecated
  form).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

Inaugural release. Published on PyPI as **`jaxht`** (`pip install jaxht` → `import jht`;
the name `jht` is unavailable on PyPI). GitHub repo and import package stay `jht`.

### Added
- **On-grid transforms** — spin-0 and spin-2 `synthesis` (a_lm → map) and the
  exact adjoint `adjoint_synthesis`, validated to machine precision against
  healpy **and** ducc0 (spin-2 inverse at the HEALPix floor, no s2fft-style
  structural defect).
- **Approximate inverse** — `bare_analysis` (Sᵀ W) and `map2alm` (jht's own ring
  quadrature weights + Jacobi iteration; ~1e-13 on band-limited maps).
- **Quadrature weights** — `ring_weights`, `pixel_weights`.
- **Partial-sky / masked** — `pseudo_alm`, `deconvolve` (cut-sky CG), `wiener`
  (masked Wiener filter / MUSE inner solve), `constrained_realization`.
- **Off-grid (NUFFT)** — `synthesis_general` / `adjoint_synthesis_general` for
  spin 0–3 at arbitrary pointings; alm- **and** pointing-differentiable under
  native autodiff. JAX-native replacement for ducc0's `synthesis_general`.
- **Differentiable real-DOF interface** — `synthesis_real`, `analysis_real`,
  `bandpower`, with the `alm_to_real` / `real_to_alm` isometry and the
  `alm_metric_weight` (2 − δ_m0) bridge.
- **GPU (CUDA)** — pure JAX, runs on GPU with no code change. Measured on Cannon
  A100/V100 (fp64): GPU==CPU parity ~1e-13 across the BK regime **including
  nside=2048**; forward synthesis 14–60× CPU. Three fp64-scatter→gather reworks (the
  `dense_to_tri` adjoint packing, the `nufft2d2` off-grid grid build, and the on-grid
  ring assembly) make the adjoint and off-grid forward fast and let nside=2048 compile.
  Parity + diagnostic harnesses `scripts/gpu_check.py`, `scripts/gpu_diagnostic.py`.
